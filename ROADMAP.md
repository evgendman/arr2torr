# Roadmap

This document distinguishes behavior that exists in **torr-arr-importer v1.0.3** from items that remain planned or need more validation.

## Implemented

- One standard-library Python implementation for both Radarr and Sonarr.
- One systemd service/timer instance per configured Arr instance.
- Polling the paginated Arr /api/v3/history endpoint on each run.
- Filtering to usable Grabbed records and normalizing/deduplicating their BitTorrent infohashes.
- Retrieving the magnet or direct torrent URL through the history data.downloadUrl, including resolution of HTTP redirects.
- Snapshotting TorrServer through POST /torrents with {"action":"list"}.
- Adding through TorrServer POST /torrents with title, movie/tv category, safe custom data JSON and save_to_db: true.
- Fetching Radarr movie or Sonarr series details to obtain trustworthy provider IDs when they are missing from history.
- Shared SQLite import history across all Arr instances.
- Per-instance lock files, retry handling for transient HTTP/network failures and redaction of API-key-like URL parameters.
- --dry-run and --rebuild.
- Protection against automatic re-adding after a user removes a known imported torrent from TorrServer.
- Useful summary logs (HISTORY, SNAPSHOT, ADD, ADDED, FAILED, DONE).

## Validated so far

- **Radarr live path:** multiple current Grabbed records imported into TorrServer with category and data.
- **Idempotency:** a second normal run sees the hashes in TorrServer and adds none.
- **Removal memory:** after a known hash is removed from TorrServer, a normal run skips it instead of restoring it.
- **Rebuild:** a missing hash is added again when --rebuild is deliberately used.
- **Incremental update:** a new Radarr Grab was observed in history and automatically imported on a subsequent timer cycle, including provider IDs.
- **Sonarr history path:** records parse and duplicate hashes are recognized correctly; a dry-run with a hash already in TorrServer produced no candidate.

The last item is not the same as a complete live test of a **new** Sonarr Grab flowing into an initially missing TorrServer hash. That end-to-end case remains to be verified.

## Planned improvements

### 1. Preserve more useful Arr metadata

v1.0.3 reads the history quality, languages and customFormats fields but the current TorrServer data payload does not persist those complete objects. Consider adding a carefully versioned and sanitized subset, for example:

- quality name/source/resolution from the grabbed decision;
- selected audio languages;
- Custom Format names and scores;
- protocol and release-type metadata where useful;
- other stable fields that help downstream NFO generation or release display.

Only non-secret, stable metadata should be stored. Credential-bearing downloadUrl and similar links must remain excluded.

### 2. Complete end-to-end Sonarr validation

Create a controlled new Sonarr Grab whose hash is absent from TorrServer. Confirm the timer sees it, resolves the download link, imports it under category tv, records the provider IDs, and skips it on the next ordinary cycle.

### 3. Make timer cadence easier to configure per instance

The current template defaults all instances to five minutes. Systemd timer drop-ins can already override offsets/intervals, but the project should provide clear examples or a supported configuration scheme so four instances can be staggered without guesswork.

### 4. Document and test clean-destination recovery

--rebuild already implements the necessary behavior without deleting shared SQLite state. Add repeatable tests that cover replacing the TorrServer database while keeping importer history, then rebuilding each Arr source without duplicate adds.

### 5. Add repeatable tests and recorded API fixtures

Add tests for:

- paginated history;
- multiple history events with the same hash;
- missing/invalid data, hash or downloadUrl;
- magnet URLs and redirect chains;
- Prowlarr API-key redaction;
- shared import history across instances;
- normal mode versus rebuild;
- TorrServer add responses with missing/mismatched hash;
- transient vs permanent HTTP status handling.

### 6. Coordinate with the downstream STRM/NFO project

The importer already preserves provider IDs and selected Arr fields in TorrServer data, which supports a downstream library tree. The related torr2strm repository is currently private. When its public status and API are settled, document an end-to-end example showing Seerr request → Arr Grab → TorrServer → STRM/NFO library.

## Explicitly not planned

- A webhook listener: polling the Arr history is the selected design.
- A Blackhole directory watcher: Blackhole permits Arr's Grab workflow, but the importer uses the Arr API and TorrServer API.
- Downloading media inside the importer: TorrServer is the receiving/streaming service.
- Silently resurrecting user-removed torrents during normal polling: rebuild must remain an explicit action.
